## Data placement
As the data necessary is too large for GitHub please use following guidelines to position the csv data files in the file structure of the repo when cloned:
- df_assay_entries.csv should be positioned in the top layer of the repo (in the same level as data_gen.py)
- csv containing the x-data (currently descriptors_x_transformed.csv) should be positioned in a folder named "data". Theoretically the data could be generated by the function in data_gen.py but it takes 1h52min to produce the data and the data is still in its raw state as the processing is only present in a Notepad.

The csv files in data can be downloaded as a zip (which should already create the folder data) via the following link: https://ucloud.univie.ac.at/index.php/s/BoaDYO7CxkTx5GI
